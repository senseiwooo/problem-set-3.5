      How to Play

    <h3>
      Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many people think that chess is a complicated game that can only be played by smart people.
      However, this simply is not true, and you can learn how to play chess in just a few minutes.
      <br>
      Chess is a game played by two players sitting opposite each other. The pieces are set up as shown from white's side.
      The pieces from the bottom row and from left to right are: the rook, the knight, the bishop, the queen, the king, another bishop,
      another knight, and another rook. In the second row, there are only pawns. In total, one side has 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops,
      1 queen, and 1 king. As shown, black's pieces are set in the same fashion paralle to white's. White moves first.

    <h3>
      The Board
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chess is played on an 8 x 8 board totaling 64 squares. The 64 squares alternate between light and dark squares.
      In order to refer to the different squares on the board individually, chess players use a notation system. The rows
      are labelled using numbers 1-8 from top to bottom. And the files (columns) are labelled using letters from A-H from left to right.
      This board orientation is shown from white's perpective.

    <h3>
      Piece Movements
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have an understanding of the position of the pieces and of the board, it is time to learn how to actually move
      the pieces.

    <h3>
      Rules
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Check
    </h4>
    <p>
      Check occurs when the King is being attacked by any enemy piece. It is illegal to capture the King so when the King is being attacked, the King must either
      move, a piece must capture the attacking piece, or a piece must block the check.
    </p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/images/check.png" height="350px" width="350px"/>
    <h4>
      Castling
    </h4>
    <p>
      Castling is allowed when the King and Rook both have not moved and there is clear path between the King and the Rook. The King must move 2 squares to the right or left and then the
      rook comes over the King, one square to the right. The King can castle on either sides of the board either Kingside or Queenside. However, you cannot castle through check, meaning
      the King is checked while moving 2 squares or while in check.
    </p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/images/castling.png" height="350px" width="350px"/>
    <h4>
      Pawn Promotion
    </h4>
    <p>
      When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can become a Rook, Knight, Bishop, or Queen. 99% of the time, you want to promote to the Queen as it is the strongest
      piece for each side.
    </p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/images/promotion.png" height="350px" width="350px"/>
    <h4>
      Checkmate
    </h4>
    <p>
      Many of you may have heard of this term when referring to chess. This is because it is how you actually win the game. Checkmate is achieved when the King is in check and there is no legal
      move to be played by the person in check. Think of it like the ruler of your kingdom being trapped and thus, all of your forces having to surrender.
    </p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/images/checkmate.png" height="350px" width="350px"/>
    <h4>
      Draw
    </h4>
    <p>
      A game does not neccessarily always end in either side winning. There are certain conditions that can lead to a draw as well. These include...
      <ol>
        <li>Opponents agreeing to one</li>
        <li>Not having enough pieces to checkmate</li>
        <li>Stalemate (i.e. when a player not having any legal moves to play and thus cannot move)</li>
        <li>Three-fold repitition (i.e the same position being repeated on the board 3 times)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>
      En Passant
    </h4>
    <p>
      En Passant is a confusing rule and one that many players do not understand. If a pawn moves forward 2 squares and an opposing pawn could have captured it if it had moved 1 square,
      that pawn is still allowed to take the pawn that moved forward 2 squares only immediately after the move has occurred.
