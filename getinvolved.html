    <h4>
      Having learned about just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the world of chess, what are ways that you can get involved in the game?
    </h4>
    <h3>
      Chess Clubs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Join your local chess club! Most are free and are great ways to meet new people and learn how to develop your chess skills at the same time.
      Playing face to face with people is a completely different experience than learning how to play online.

    <h3>
      Join tournaments
    </h3>
    <p>
      When I went to my first tournament, I lost nearly all of my games. However, I learned a lot of new lessons from every game I lost. The only way to truly improve
      is if you are able to take losses and analye your mistakes in them. Tournaments are hosted every week in various different locations across the state and country.
      For a list of tournaments in your area, click <a href="http://www.uschess.org/tlas/upcoming.php" target="_blank" >here</a>

    <h3>
      Read books
    </h3>
    <p>
      Reading books is what I believe is the quickest way to learn new information on chess. You are able to find a vast array of types of chess books. Some are on the opening,
      middle game, endgame and others are on the biographies and games of separate players. You will certainly find a book that interests you with the wide range of books available.

    <h3>
      Learn and Play Online
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another great resource for learning and playing chess is the internet. For example, there are many great videos on Youtube on learning chess and also on complex chess tactics.
      Playing chess online is a great way to learn as well since you are playing against real people. Sites like <a href="http://www.chess.com" target="_blank">chess.com</a> offer things such as puzzles, challenges, various time controls,
      and more. Additionally, you can even look at the games of top level players online to see how they play.
